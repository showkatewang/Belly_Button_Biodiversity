## Overview

The purpose of this project is to assist the microbiology lab that partnered with Improbable Beef, a food start-up, to find the microorganism that will best mimic the taste of beef. Different microbiome exists on or within different regions of the human body and also different individuals. This study holds the assumption that the microorganism that mimics the taste of beef resides within a certain individual's naval region. This study samples individuals from across the country and anonymizes each person by utilizing ID numbers. To assist the lab in their study, I created a dynamic dashboard to select an ID and display the microbiome within the belly button of each participant.
